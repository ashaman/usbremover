= Some plans for future =

I'm really very busy at the university, so that's why I still have not enough time to continue the develelopment. I'll put here a list of <b>some good ideas:</b>

<ol>
<li>Implement the core part as a system service (in order to have access to hardware)</li>
<li>Rewrite the core of the project on C/C++</li>
<li>Port the GUI from Delphi to Lazarus</li>
<li>Add 64-bit version</li>
<li>Invent a good logo for the project ;-)</li>
<li>Maybe write a piece of documentation</li>
</ol>

And, of course, I'm waiting for your new ideas!

Cheers, <br>
