USB Remover - free, open source analog of USB Safely Remove

We wanted to do a very useful application for Windows and we noticed that there's no appropriate flash drive remover which is free! So, we want the situation to change. If someone's interested in development, please, mail me (DarthYarius_0990@mail.ru) or my colleague Yury.

The process of development started today. I have started to implement abstract class for device manager.

After some consultations we decided that I should do the device manager and Yury - process manager.
I found a very interesting article for processes and files management. The only difficulty is to translate C++ code to Delphi...

Some difficulties occured with getting size and serial number of flash drive. I hope I'll solve 'em in one-two hours tomorrow.
And next, the mein problem is to notify all running Windoes applications that the flash drive was ejected
