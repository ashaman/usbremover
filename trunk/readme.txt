USB Remover - free, open source analog of USB Safely Remove

We wanted to do a very useful application for Windows and we noticed that there's no appropriate flash drive remover which is free! So, we want the situation to change. If someone's interested in development, please, mail me (DarthYarius_0990@mail.ru) or my colleague Yury.

The process of development started today. I have started to implement abstract class for device manager.

After some consultations we decided that I should do the device manager and Yury - process manager.
I found a very interesting article for processes and files management. The only difficulty is to translate C++ code to Delphi...

Some difficulties occured with getting size and serial number of flash drive. I hope I'll solve 'em in one-two hours tomorrow.
And next, the main problem is to notify all running Windows applications that the flash drive was ejected

I found WMI libraries in Delphi 7. To add them, it's necessary to do the following things
	1) install MS SDK 5.0 or higher
	2) import type libraries
		a) Active DS Type Library
		b) Microsoft WMI Scripting (v. 1.2) library
So, now I'll try to use them in my program

Some problems occured when I found out that on my telephone there are two separate drives! But this is the only device! When something is opened from one drive, and I'm trying to eject another - it fails! So, it's necessary to solve this problem. My idea is to find all removeable devices in system, get their children, and for each child - check if there are any processes using files on it.

Ok, the development is in progress... I hope we'll finish the model until the end of this week...

YEAH!!! I detect device arrivals and removals!!! But there's one great problem... VCL forms does not permit to call their methods from another thread
